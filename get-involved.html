      <p class="text-center cursiveme">"Find out what you can do to help La Brigada"</p>
      <p>There are many ways you can help out La Brigada. We always need more adult supervisors - spanish language skills are helpful but not neccessary. You are more than welcome to come with us when we clean the streets and help us keep an eye on the kids. After the pickup we have had successful afternoon activies like basketball, a choir, and english lessons. The availability of these activies depends almost entirely on our volunteers so if there's something you'd like to do please let us know!</p>
      <p>Donations of Toys, Trash Bags, Candy, Gloves etc. are more than welcome. School supplies are usually a big hit with the kids and really help out their families. One of our volunteers once brought in two boxes of toothbrushes. Turns out most of the kids were sharing theirs at home with siblings and/or parents and just loved getting a toothbrush of their own. It goes to show that even the most simple things can make a major difference in the kid's lives, anything you choose help them with will be greaty appreciated.</p>
      <p>We usually start our Christmas Toy Drive around Thanksgiving time. We'd love for you to bring in a toy, unwrapped, for either a boy or a girl toddler to teenager - Santa and his helpers will hand them all out on Christmas Eve.</p>
      <p>Of course cash donations are more than welcome as well. They help us greatly with buying trash bags, gloves, hot dogs, chips, toys etc. every week. Eventually we hope to get enough support that we can purchase permanent trash receptacles for the barrio.</p>
      <p>Just come on by any Saturday morning and meet the wonderful children of La Brigada de la Basura. We would all love to see you!</p>
