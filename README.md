The purpose of this project is to create a website for a charity that supports local children in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.

A user would want to use our website to combine their vacation or retirement in Puerto Vallarta with giving back to the community. They would benefit by making a positive difference in the lives of the children they support. The user would visit our website because currently the charity doesn't have a website.

The purpose of the video in our website is to gain insight and introduce La Brigada de la Basura (The Trash Brigade) to the user.
