      <p class="text-center cursiveme">"Working for a better future"</p>
      <p>In 2010 Michael and Yvonne Hayes upon walking around the streets of their neighborhood were saddened and disgusted by the amounts of trash lying around everywhere. Apart from simply being unhygienic the piles of trash are also a breeding ground for the mosquitos carrying the dangerous Dengue virus. So they decided to bring to life “La Brigada de la Basura” - The Trash Brigade”.</p>

      <p>Every Saturday at 11:30am the neighborhood children are invited to meet at Que?Pasa. They are given trash bags and latex gloves; then with adult supervision they walk through the local streets picking up every piece of trash they can find on the streets and sidewalks. We plan our route to end up back at Que?Pasa where the children are rewarded with grilled Hot-Dogs, chips, soft drinks, a child oriented movie and a small bag of sweets. Every week two children are chosen to be Ayudantes (Helpers). They help serving the other children food and drink and afterwards help cleaning up the mess they made. It’s a highly coveted job, considering it is rewarded with a toy! After the meal is done the children are welcome to join us for free English lessons on our patio.</br>
      The turn-out for the first Saturday was better than we expected - 17 kids. Today we are averaging 60-70 kids every week. We started off small - concentrating on only a two block radius from the restaurant. Currently we have doubled our clean-up area and switch between the streets and the river shores every week. As attendance increases we hope to expand that radius as well.</p>

      <p>Since the start of our program we have noticed a difference in our neighborhood as we keep educating the kids about the environment and the importance of protecting it. We hope to teach the children responsibility, the importance of cleaning up after yourself (not just in the streets but also inside after a meal!) and also hope to promote inter-cultural communication between the locals and the expats and visitors. Most of all, every Saturday we have a whole lot of fun!</p>
