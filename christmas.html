      <p>Together with La Brigada de la Basura Michael and Yvonne Hayes also started a Toy Drive every Christmas. Every year they ask their customers to bring in a toy and put it under their Christmas Tree.</p>

      <p> On Christmas Eve Santa and Mrs Claus start the festivities by walking around the neighborhood, giving out candy to all the children they meet and inviting them to Que?Pasa for the evening.</p>

      <p>At Que?Pasa, while the adults party inside, Santa and Mrs.Claus have a party for all the local children outside the restaurant that starts with at least three piñatas and eventually leads to Santa’s helpers handing out toys to all the children. The party grows every year and this past Christmas we gave out free toys to over 350 local children!</p>

      <p>Everybody is welcome at our Christmas party and Santa is always glad to have as many helpers as possible. As you can imagine handing out that many gifts is quite a lot of work for Santa! So bring your friends, bring your family - hang out at Que?Pasa, enjoy our live music and Christmas ham, listen to our La Brigada kid's choir sing a few Chritmas Tunes and feel your heart melt when you watch the smiles and happy faces of the children as they receive their presents. It’s by far our favorite night of the year!
